                Warning: If you server is located in Russia, all servers in Russia are now blocked due to massive amounts of API abuse. Almost 17 million requests were placed within a 24 hour period. For perspective, the next closest highest amount of requests was the USA with 34,000. So Russia is now banned. Please place your server in a country that doesn't promote API abuse, or tries to actively DDOS our service.
